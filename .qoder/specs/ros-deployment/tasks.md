# CogniPlan ROS Deployment - Implementation Tasks

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation tasks for deploying the CogniPlan system on a real robot with 3D LiDAR using ROS 1 Noetic. The implementation follows a distributed node architecture with clearly defined responsibilities for each component.

## Implementation Tasks

- [ ] 1. **Setup and Configuration**
  - Create ROS package structure for cogniplan_deployment
  - Set up CMakeLists.txt and package.xml files
  - Configure launch files for system startup
  - Define custom message and service definitions

- [ ] 2. **Sensor Integration Implementation**
  - Implement lidar_interface_node for 3D LiDAR data acquisition
  - Add filtering and preprocessing capabilities
  - Create publisher for processed sensor data
  - Implement sensor diagnostics and health monitoring

- [ ] 3. **Map Management Implementation**
  - Implement map_manager_node for map creation and updates
  - Integrate SLAM library for simultaneous localization and mapping
  - Create services for map loading, saving, and clearing
  - Add dynamic obstacle tracking capabilities

- [ ] 4. **CogniPlan Model Integration**
  - Implement cogniplan_planner_node to load and execute trained model
  - Create subscribers for sensor and map data inputs
  - Implement planning service interfaces
  - Add publisher for motion commands and planned paths

- [ ] 5. **Robot Control Implementation**
  - Implement robot_controller_node for motion control
  - Add differential drive kinematics calculations
  - Create velocity smoothing and safety limit enforcement
  - Implement hardware driver interfaces

- [ ] 6. **Navigation Coordination**
  - Implement navigation_coordinator_node for workflow orchestration
  - Add goal management and state transition logic
  - Implement recovery behaviors for failure cases
  - Create action server for high-level navigation

- [ ] 7. **Visualization and Monitoring**
  - Implement visualization_node for system monitoring
  - Add publishers for diagnostic information
  - Create interactive markers for goal setting
  - Integrate with Foxglove Studio visualization

- [ ] 8. **System Integration and Testing**
  - Create integrated launch files for complete system
  - Implement parameter configuration files
  - Conduct integration testing of all components
  - Validate end-to-end navigation capabilities

- [ ] 9. **Documentation and Examples**
  - Create README with system overview and usage instructions
  - Document all custom messages and services
  - Provide example launch configurations
  - Add troubleshooting guide
